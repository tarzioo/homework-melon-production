<strong>Subject:</strong> Winter Squashes Are Coming!!!!!!

Hey!

So I wanted to send a note out to give you a heads up about some big
changes coming up!

Our CEO has decided to confront Squysh head on, and so we're going to
be introducing our new line of Ubermelon Winter Squashes in just 10 days.

As you know, our CEO has invested billions of VC money in our robotic
production and order fulfillment delivery chain.  It's all managed
by the code in <cite>shipping_procedure.py</cite>.  It works great with melons
(e.g. when processing the <cite>standing_orders1.log</cite> file) -- but can you
check to see what we need to change so that it can handle Squashes?
The file <cite>standing_orders2.log</cite> has an order for squashes.

Before shipping, all melons are evaluated by the InspectorBot for
quality standards. The Winter Squashes are being rejected because they
are not green like the watermelons are.  We've contacted the company
that made the InspectorBot, but they've informed us it will cost
millions of dollars in consulting fees to upgrade the robot's software
to handle two types of melons.  As a result, the CEO has decided it
would be best to paint the Winter Squash green to match the watermelons.

Please update the robot control script (which you'll find in
<cite>shipping_procedure.py</cite>) to add a Squash melon class that has the
special prep procedure to paint the squashes correctly.  To invoke the
paint bot that's already been installed at the factory, you can call
the following function:

    robots.painterbot.paint(self)


Thanks for your help,
Mel
Team Lead

P.S. Don't <strong>change anything</strong> about the <cite>robots.py</cite> file. You should
be able to make any necessary changes in <cite>shipping_procedure.py</cite>.  Both of
these files can be found in the usual location.
</pre>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add a squash class to shipping_procedure.py to handle winter squashes. (We're conidering squashes to be a type of melon.)</li>
<li>Add a method to your squash class that handles the prep plus painting of squashes.</li>
<li>(Hint: try processing the standing_orders2 log with our shipping procedure to see what happens to melons currently.)</li>
<li>(Don't get bogged down in robots.py.  You don't need to do anything with that file.)</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Don't Get Lost!</strong></p>
<p class="last">It is important that you don't get bogged down in the sort of &quot;black-box&quot;-yness of
the methods here. This is largely about learning to function within a somewhat complicated
object oriented script. It's complicated and sometimes confusing--but what you actually have to
do here is fairly simple. Try not to get caught up in all the things you don't understand.</p>

<p><strong>EXTRA CREDIT:</strong> We've been learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) here at Hackbright, but
you may (or may not) have heard of another programming paradigm called Functional Programming (FP).
